## GoF(Gang of Four) design pattern
* Design patterns are typically split into three categories

</br>

### 1. Creational Patterns
* Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
* Explicit(constructor) vs implicit(DI, reflection, etc.)
* Wholesale(single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step)

</br>

* [Factory](./creational/factory/)
* [Factory Method](./creational/factory_method/)
* [Singleton](./creational/singleton/)
* WIP

</br>

### 2. Structural Patterns
* Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
* Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
* Stress the importance of good API design

</br>

* WIP

</br>

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
* They are all differenct; no central theme

</br>

* [Observer](./behavior/observer/)
* [State](./behavior/state/)
* [Strategy](./behavior/strategy/)
* [Template Method](./behavior/template_method/)
* WIP
