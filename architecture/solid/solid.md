## Following the SOLID and DRY principles

* When writing object-oriented code, you shoud be familiar with the quartet of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* Regardless of whether your writing C++ in a mostly object-oriented programming manner or net, you should keep in mind the principles behind the two acronyms: SOLID and DRY

</br>

* SOLID is a set of practices that can help you write cleaner and less bug-prone software. It's an acronym made from the first letters of the five concepts behind it:

    * Single reponsibility principle
    * Open-closed principle
    * Liskov subsititution principle
    * Interface segregation
    * Dependency Inversion

* We assume you already have the idea of how those principles relate to object-oriented programming, but since C++ is not always object-oriented.
